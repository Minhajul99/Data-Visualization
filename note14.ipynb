    "I first want to examine [Tamara Munzner's text](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/vadbook/) from 2014 because she tries to lay out a general methodological design scheme based on psychological, perceptual and design principles.\n",
    "* She introduces some terminology of her own so be aware of this\n",
    "* The fundamental three questions of her approach are easy to understand and can be used even if you do not have technical knowledge of all possible choices in her system.\n",
    "* But I think her approach is weak in some aspects:\n",
    "    * Often it is very important to understand the domain of the data collection to design useful visuals: you have to be able to interpret the data and visuals according to the subject-matter of interest. Her approach does not give enough emphasis on this.\n",
    "    * Limitations and design opportunities due to hardware, data sources, and social influences are not accounted for in her approach.\n",
    "    * So far there is little use of animation or user interaction in her system. \n",

    "I have a slide viewer coded in python in this jupyter notebook, but it probably is easier just to use Munzner's original slides. It takes a bit more work to turn jupyter into a decent slide viewer.  I decided not to commit the individual slide images to the notes repository, since it's a waste of space. You can still [access those images](slidesMunzner.zip) if you really want to view the slides using the viewer code in this jupyter notebook.\n",
